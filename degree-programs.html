           At UNCOMMON App, we operate with three foundational principles in approaching undergraduate admissions: collaboration, strategy & structure, and customization & flexibility.
            <br><br>
           <span style="font-style: italic;">Collaboration:</span> Every student and family has unique needs. In order for your student to achieve their goals, the college application process should be collaborative between student, family, and counselor. We’ve been there: we understand that your teenager is going through a difficult stage, so we are steadfastly respectful of their personality and sensitive to individual circumstances. At the same time, parents are vital partners in this process and deserve utmost consideration.

           <br>
           <span style="font-style: italic;">Strategy & Structure:</span> From development of the initial college list to visit planning, financial aid discussions to essay writing, each phase of UNCOMMON App’s comprehensive plan is approached deliberately and strategically. In a confusing and often overwhelming process, we offer a clear and customized strategy broken into stages with step-by-step tasks. We will give your student an individualized series of steps—this way, there's never a question about what needs to be done next. 
           <br><br>
           <span style="font-style: italic;">Customization & Flexibility:</span> Whether your student is a high school freshman searching for a general strategy or a last-minute, panicking senior, we will customize any plan to optimize results for your student. Some students are fiercely independent and resent even the mildest suggestions for their essays or college choices; others are less confident and need lots of help and encouragement. Our flexible style adjusts to each student’s personality and pace.

    We’ve worked successfully with students from the British, French, and Russian educational systems who have accepted places at American universities like UChicago, UMW, Northeastern, CUNY Hunter College, SUNY Stony Brook, New York University, and Brandeis among others. Our acceptances for students seeking an international degree include Oxford, St. Andrew’s, London School of Economics, University of Edinburgh, King’s College London, University College London, Imperial College (United Kingdom), SciencesPo (France), and Vrije Universiteit (the Netherlands).
    <br><br>
    <strong>US-based students are applying abroad now more than ever. </strong>Education systems, admissions, and student life vary enormously across cultural lines. If you’re interested in an international degree, your commitment to your program is crucial. Defining and identifying your interests and creating realistic expectations are key to getting started. UNCOMMON App is uncommonly prepared to help you do just that.

As such, our focus is on English-instructed programs and dual programs that reward bachelors, masters, and combined degrees.</span>

      A medical career can be extremely rewarding, but admission into medical school is highly competitive—and premedical life can be stressful. Guidance and advocacy from our med school specialist, Dan Block, can increase the chance of a successful outcome and make the process more comprehensible. What does this mean?
      <br><br>
      <strong>Evaluate early. </strong>Not all students arrive at the premedical track with the same aptitudes, experiences, and ambitions. Selecting a major, deciding when to take core premedical classes, supplementing academic work with appropriate extracurriculars, and beginning to engage in clinical and research activities are all part of the premedical experience, but different students benefit from different paths. This includes when to apply to medical school, and whether gap years are appropriate.

      <br>
      <strong>Keep the MCAT top of mind. </strong>Considering the MCAT throughout college is crucial so the exam doesn't become overwhelming once it’s too late. When students encounter more rigorous coursework like organic chemistry and physics in school, MCAT-testable topics can be distinguished and reinforced later. Finally, when the time comes for more intense MCAT preparation, developing a study calendar, lightening up other responsibilities, and ensuring high-quality instruction are essential.

<br><br>
      <strong>Create a professional application that tells your story. </strong>Once a student decides which schools to apply to and which degree programs make the most sense, the application and admissions processes can be daunting. Students have essays to write, activities to describe, and, depending on the school, situational response tests to complete. The application is most effective when it tells a story instead of providing a resume. Giving readers an understanding of the applicant on a personal level can help create the most memorable impression.
    <br><br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Dan has partnered with Elena for more than 15 years on MCAT prep and medical school admissions. Dan’s intimate knowledge of the admission process, unique understanding of the intricacies of MCAT, and outstanding success rate make him the ideal coach. In her advisory role at a large research university, Elena worked with countless premedical students, exposing her to the nuances and challenges of the premedical process. Together, Dan and Elena activate their combined expertise to guide students towards their goals and prepare them for MCAT success and a positive admissions experience.</span>
