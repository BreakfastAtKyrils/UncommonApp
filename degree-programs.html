        A medical career can be extremely rewarding, but admission into medical school is highly competitive—and premedical life can be stressful. Guidance and advocacy from our med school specialist, Dan Block, can increase the chance of a successful outcome and make the process more comprehensible. What does this mean?
 
        <strong>Evaluate early. </strong>Not all students arrive at the premedical track with the same aptitudes, experiences, and ambitions. Selecting a major, deciding when to take core premedical classes, supplementing academic work with appropriate extracurriculars, and beginning to engage in clinical and research activities are all part of the premedical experience, but different students benefit from different paths. This includes when to apply to medical school, and whether gap years are appropriate.

         <strong>Keep the MCAT top of mind. </strong>Considering the MCAT throughout college is crucial so the exam doesn't become overwhelming once it’s too late. When students encounter more rigorous coursework like organic chemistry and physics in school, MCAT-testable topics can be distinguished and reinforced later. Finally, when the time comes for more intense MCAT preparation, developing a study calendar, lightening up other responsibilities, and ensuring high-quality instruction are essential.
         <br><br>

         <strong>Create a professional application that tells your story. </strong>Once a student decides which schools to apply to and which degree programs make the most sense, the application and admissions processes can be daunting. Students have essays to write, activities to describe, and, depending on the school, situational response tests to complete. The application is most effective when it tells a story instead of providing a resume. Giving readers an understanding of the applicant on a personal level can help create the most memorable impression.

          Dan has partnered with Elena for more than 15 years on MCAT prep and medical school admissions. Dan’s intimate knowledge of the admission process, unique understanding of the intricacies of MCAT, and outstanding success rate make him the ideal coach. In her advisory role at a large research university, Elena worked with countless premedical students, exposing her to the nuances and challenges of the premedical process. Together, Dan and Elena activate their combined expertise to guide students towards their goals and prepare them for MCAT success and a positive admissions experience.

       Uncommon App is uniquely positioned to offer comprehensive guidance on graduate school admission. Elena has two decades of experience counseling students in a university careers center—her sensitivity and familiarity with guiding young people onto new journeys in employment and academics is a throughline in her work as a consultant.<br><br>
          So, what does it really take to find the graduate program meant for you? At Uncommon App, we’ll help you dig through the pros, cons, highs, lows, and grey areas.<br><br>
          When thinking about grad school, it’s important to be aware of the not-so-good reasons you may want to explore an extra degree. For instance, simply wanting a higher salary, feeling concerned about future employment, and harboring a “now or never” mentality are the top excuses many students use when convincing themselves they should.
