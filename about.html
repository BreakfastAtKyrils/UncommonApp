      <br>
      <div class="h3">Founder & Principal Consultant</div>
      <br>
      Dr. Elena Polenova is an experienced educational consultant and professional psychologist with an international, interdisciplinary background. She has completed graduate degrees from two different countries and has over two decades of experience working in a university environment. Elena arrived in the U.S. in 1989 as a doctoral student and because of a different educational system here, she  found herself having to relearn everything she once knew, about education; in the process, she fell in love with the complicated and vibrant American education system. Making Stony Brook University her home base, Elena held the position of Associate Director of  Counseling at  Stony Brook’s Career Center where she was responsible for helping with graduate school applications and working with pre-med and undecided students. She also served on the Honors College Advisory board and admissions committee, was a member of the teaching faculty, gained a few notable awards, and presented extensively at national and international conferences. 
      <br><br>
      As a parent of first-generation American college students, Elena understands and honors feeling an exceptionally complicated pressure. At home, she accompanied her three very different children on three very unique journeys into college admissions which led to Williams College, Yale and Stony Brook. The rocky roads leading to and from their undergraduate acceptances illustrate the surprises, disappointments, and fascinating unpredictability of choosing the right school. Through these experiences, Elena developed empathy for parents going through the application process with their children and dedicated her career to helping them.
      <br><br>
      Elena’s extensive knowledge of and intimate familiarity with higher education admissions processes prompted countless friends and colleagues to solicit advice and assistance from her. As the requests piled up, Elena was  motivated to devote her full time attention to education consulting on a full-time basis in 2017. Consummate professional, she joined Independent Educational Consultants Associations (IECA). Her rate of success and renowned approach to her cohort of prestigious students are why Uncommon App thrives exclusively on referrals.
      <br><br>
      In Elena’s free time, she likes to read classic British mysteries while cuddling with her cats, play tennis, and swim in open water. She is obsessed with feeling the vibes of college campuses and squeezes campus tours into every vacation.
