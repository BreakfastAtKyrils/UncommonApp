                        Elena has been extremely helpful with every aspect of my applications. She provides great guidance about what colleges are really looking for, how to make those things be reflected in your experiences, and how to make those experiences be reflected in your applications. From strategizing about where to prioritize my efforts in competitions to helping me bring out my unique voice and character traits in essays, Elena has helped me to produce an application that reflects every facet of my personality and strengths in a forceful yet nuanced manner. Meanwhile, Dan’s systematic approach to the SAT makes test preparation efficient and much less stressful. Your SAT score quickly becomes a reflection of how many simple mistakes you make (which Dan’s strategies greatly minimize), because you know how to solve every question. Working with both of them has been immensely helpful in being accepted into elite summer camps, scholarships, and colleges.

                        Working with Elena has been an absolute pleasure! The dedication and work she and her team put in cannot be overstated. Before working with her, I was lost in the grueling and intimidating college application process. She meticulously worked with me to plan and organize my application and admission journey. Elena helped me not only craft a coherent and compelling application but also find my voice, ensuring my personality shone through in every piece of writing. She and her editor, Angela, promptly reviewed every single one of my essays with care and honesty, and didn't hold back to ensure they were perfect. Angela's thoughtful and relentless critiques were instrumental in polishing and elevating my essays. Thanks to their guidance, I couldn’t be happier with my results.

                        I truly don’t know what I would have done without Elena. A family friend recommended her to us during my sophomore year, and I couldn’t be more grateful that they did. My family and I were completely lost when it came to the college application process, but Elena walked us through every step with incredible knowledge, patience, and care. She helped me focus and shape my interests in a way that made sense for me — not just to impress colleges, but also to grow as a person. She guided me toward schools that were the right fit and made sure I was doing everything I could to become a strong applicant. Thanks to her help, I felt confident in my applications. Her partner Dan was also amazing: even with limited time, he helped me raise my SAT score to the level which I originally would think possible. Beyond the logistics and deadlines, Elena was a crucial source of support during the most stressful part of my high school career. I absolutely recommend Elena to anyone navigating college admissions. She definitely made all the difference for me, and I’m incredibly thankful to have had her in my corner.

                        Working with Elena was one of the most grounding parts of my college application process. She brings a thoughtful, patient approach and draws on her background in psychology to understand each applicant as a whole person. Elena helped me shape my essays and overall application with intention, thinking critically about each response (even if I was tempted to settle). She was always willing to revisit ideas until they genuinely reflected my voice. The college admissions process can be incredibly stressful, and Elena was not only a knowledgeable guide but also a reassuring presence throughout. I also want to highlight Dan Block, an outstanding SAT preparation specialist. His clear teaching and strategic guidance was unparalleled and essential to my success on the exam.

                        I am incredibly grateful to have gotten to work with Dr. Elena Polenova throughout my college application process.

I am especially glad to have worked with her and her editing team

                        Thank you for shepherding us through this messy process and for helping  us stay sane. We learned a lot about ourselves and about our son through  the journey, and are very grateful for that.

                        There are so many good things to say about working with you. Your  insights, advice, suggestions were spot on. You kept it real, but were  always positive and helped our son stay positive. You let him know that the  decisions were his to make, and even respected his decision not to apply  ED (we were a bit nervous).
                        
                        Above all, however, what we are most grateful for is that you gave him the  confidence to be himself and to truly speak in the first person regarding his  goals and interests, all of which will continue to serve him well! His essays  were so authentically him!
                        
                        We are confident that Columbia is a good fit for him and look forward to this  next adventure. We will stay in touch. Thank you for everything, Elena!

                        As someone who was incredibly uninformed of the entire college application process, Elena completely guided me through everything. She provided ample resources for me, be it by having professionals review my essays or by personally helping me brainstorm interests and activities for the Common App. Her scheduling helped keep me on track, and took away a lot of the stress I would have felt had I gone through this process alone. I felt that every essay review by her writing coach left my supplementals stronger, and felt very comfortable talking to her about any concerns or comments on my work.

While studying for the SAT, I also was guided through this process by her colleague Dan. He provided excellent tutoring and raised my first practice score by 170 points! He made it very easy to understand the different techniques used on these types of tests, and also helped me not fall behind with my review.

Overall I would—and have—recommended their services to my friends going through this process, since they truly helped me achieve the results and get into my dream colleges.

                        Elena Polenova proved exceptionally helpful to me and my son as the latter was considering his university application process from the UK high school to the US colleges. Her experience and understanding of the process helped guide us to various summer programs which helped shape my son in making a better university decision. She also advised on how he should best channel his personality and experiences to stand out in his university essays. I strongly recommend Elena and her team to anyone considering a university application - and to get involved with them as soon as possible in this process.

                        I cannot say enough good things about Elena. My son was accepted at seven of the eight schools to which he applied and there is no question Elena played an essential role in that success. Throughout the process of working with Henry, Elena became a close friend and someone I admire deeply. It’s hard to imagine a more skilled and sensitive guide through such an angst-ridden journey. She helped keep both my son, my wife, and I sane. Working with her unquestionably avoided a lot of tension in our household.

                        Time and time again, Elena managed to walk the line with Henry of being encouraging and helpful while also upholding accountability. She is highly emotionally intelligent, and was really focused on learning all she could about who Henry is as a student and a person, and then using that understanding to help him reach his own conclusion about what was the right school for him and the best way of getting in there.
                        
                        Elena was easy to reach via email, text or phone, and found time for us whenever we needed it. She also does the little things that can make a big difference in the process—finding out which schools have strong programs in a given interest, digging up helpful website links, tracking down the right people to contact in a department, relevant testimonials, etc. The little things that actually made a difference in my son’s decision making process. We really miss being in touch with her!

                        When I first started the college admissions process, I didn’t know where to start. Everything was so overwhelming, and although I knew that I wanted to find a college I loved, I didn’t know how to. From my first meeting with Elena, all that changed. Elena helped me create a clear plan to get through the next six months of work. She linked me with an excellent SAT tutor (who helped raise my score 120 points), recommended colleges she knew I would love, explained the behind-the-scenes of the college admissions process, turned my ideas from rough ideas to polished finished products, and encouraged me the  whole time. Elena is an excellent professional, and shared her years of  experience with the sole intention of finding my best-fit college. As a person,  Elena is funny, no-nonsense, and incredibly kind. I couldn’t be more happy with  my decision to reach out to her. Next year, I will attend Middlebury College. I  am so excited! I couldn’t have done it without Elena. I cannot recommend her  more highly. I wish you the best in your application process!

                        Elena Polenova is a Godsend. She counseled my son through the college  application process and he has been accepted with generous merit scholarship  offers at all of his top choices. Elena's experience and understanding of the  process is invaluable and easily saved us tens of thousands of dollars in tuition  expenses. She helped my son choose topics for his college essays and once he  wrote them she had them rigorously and skillfully copy-edited for submission.  Hiring Elena is a no-brainer if you care about your child's success

                        I can not speak highly enough about my experience with Elena. I was initially so nervous about the college application process, but with her abundant knowledge, resources, and support, all my worries disappeared. She supported me in every aspect of the college process, whether that was mental support, guidance and advice when exploring my options, or answering any and all of my questions at a moment's notice. She was brutally honest with me about everything, and in turn I could be honest and comfortable with her. Elena was more than a resource. She was a friend and an amazing support system during a stressful and uncertain time. She was always honest with me about everything, and in turn I  could be honest and comfortable with her.I especially appreciated that Elena's main focus is finding a college where her students will be happy. She doesn't base her recommendations on any ranking or online list. She truly cares about finding the perfect fit for her students, and wishes for their happiness, success, and well-being above anything else. She takes the time to connect with her students on a personal level, and it makes all the difference.

                        Overall, Elena connected me with resources and opportunities that I never would have had access to prior to applying to college. In addition, during the actual application process, she treated each and every application with so much thought, time, and effort. Elena approaches the college application process with such passion, love, humor, and a genuine care for her students. I couldn't be more grateful for her help, and I would highly recommend her to all.

                        Our experience working with Elena over the course of three years  and culminating in our son getting multiple college offers,  including many with significant financial packages, was nothing  short of extraordinary. The genuine care with which she

                        undertook every interaction resulted in a trusted relationship  between her and our son, which meant that when it came time to  write and submit applications, our involvement was minimal. That  meant that our son felt truly empowered in the process, which  helped prepare him for the rigor of university life.
                        
                        We started working with Elena during the summer of freshman  year. She both supported his interests and helped guide him  towards extracurricular activities that would serve to enrich his
                        
                        education, making him a better candidate for college
                        
                        admissions. When it came time to take standardized tests, her  test prep partner Dan was simply extraordinary, helping our son  raise his already high score to amazing on the SAT. More  importantly, throughout the process, my son was empowered to  be not just an active participant, but to take ownership of his  education. We have already recommended her to numerous  families, and in each case the results have been similarly  remarkable. Elena doesn't just help a kid get into college; Elena  ensures that a child is well matched with his choices, that the  child is engaged and actively participating, resulting in a very  positive college admissions process.

                        Elena was the most important piece to my admission process. As the oldest  child in my family, I was very naive about the process and would have become  lost in the essays and communications with all of the universities. Her great  experience in this field is an incredible asset. With Elena's commitment to me  and my goals, she developed into not only a mentor but honestly a friend,  with whom I could talk freely, and for whom I had and will have a continuous  respect and gratitude. I can not speak any more highly of Elena, nor thank her  enough for everything she has done.

Elena walked with  us on a complicated journey over many months as we navigated each step.  She advised us on every aspect of our search, including on college options,  testing strategies, applications, visits, and interviews. Elena is always patient, generous with her time, extremely knowledgeable, and caring. She is also wonderfully straightforward and direct, and her approach is exactly what we needed to help our daughter choose the best college for her. As a result of Elena’s hard work with our family, our daughter gained admission to several extremely competitive colleges, including her top choice. Thank you, Elena!!!

I have experience with other providers and she stands out because of her genuine care for kids, for their success and well -being. She goes out of her way to find the best opportunities for increasing college acceptance chances and she has an extensive network that enables her to do that. She can relate to both teenagers and parents, to people of different cultural and economic backgrounds. Her experience, intelligence, knowledge, integrity, and warmth help to remove a lot of stress from the process.

She has demonstrated insider knowledge into the graduate school admission process and is ingenious with her ideas! She made me carefully consider every aspect of the application process. Elena’s commitment not only helped me find schools that were matches for my career aspirations, but also helped me identify the transferable skills I didn’t realize I had. Then, she helped me to carefully craft and redraft my admissions essays to sound more eloquent (and clever!) than I ever could have imagined. I seriously can’t recommend her enough! Thank you again!
