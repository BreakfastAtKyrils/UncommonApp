                        Working with Elena has been an absolute pleasure! The dedication and work she and
                        her team put in cannot be overstated. Before working with her, I was lost in the
                        grueling and intimidating college application process. She meticulously worked with
                        me to plan and organize my application and admission journey. Elena helped me not
                        only craft a coherent and compelling application but also find my voice, ensuring my
                        personality shone through in every piece of writing. She and her editor, Angela,
                        promptly reviewed every single one of my essays with care and honesty, and didn&#39;t
                        hold back to ensure they were perfect. Angela&#39;s thoughtful and relentless critiques
                        were instrumental in polishing and elevating my essays. Thanks to their guidance, I
                        couldn’t be happier with my results.

                        Elena has been our college counseling ‘guardian angel’ since she first started working
                        with my daughter on her college search last year. Elena walked with us on a
                        complicated journey over many months as we navigated each step. She advised us
                        on every aspect of our search, including on college options, testing strategies,
                        applications, visits, and interviews. Elena is always patient, generous with her time,
                        extremely knowledgeable, and caring. She is also wonderfully straightforward and
                        direct, and her approach is exactly what we needed to help our daughter choose the
                        best college for her. As a result of Elena’s hard work with our family, our daughter
                        gained admission to several extremely competitive colleges, including her top choice.
                        Thank you, Elena!!!

                        kids, for their success and well -being. She goes out of her way to find the best
                        opportunities for increasing college acceptance chances and she has an extensive
                        network that enables her to do that. She can relate to both teenagers and parents,
                        to people of different cultural and economic backgrounds. Her experience,
                        intelligence, knowledge, integrity, and warmth help to remove a lot of stress from
                        the process.

                        helped me find schools that were matches for my career aspirations, but also helped

                        When I first started the college admissions process, I didn’t know where to start.
                        Everything was so overwhelming, and although I knew that I wanted to find a college
                        I loved, I didn’t know how to. From my first meeting with Elena, all that changed.
                        Elena helped me create a clear plan to get through the next six months of work. She
                        linked me with an excellent SAT tutor (who helped raise my score 120 points),
                        recommended colleges she knew I would love, explained the behind-the-scenes of
                        the college admissions process, turned my ideas from rough ideas to polished
                        finished products, and encouraged me the whole time. Elena is an excellent
                        professional, and shared her years of experience with the sole intention of finding
                        my best-fit college. As a person, Elena is funny, no-nonsense, and incredibly kind. I

                        choose topics for his college essays and once he wrote them she had them rigorously
                        
                        and skillfully copy-edited for submission. Hiring Elena is a no-brainer if you care
                        about your child&#39;s success.

                        Elena shepherded us through this messy process and helped us stay sane. We
                        learned a lot about ourselves and about our son through the journey, and are very
                        grateful for that. 
                        There are so many good things to say about working with Elena and her team.
                        Elena’s insights, advice, suggestions were spot on. She kept it real, but was always
                        positive and helped our son stay positive. She let him know that the decisions were
                        his to make, and even respected his decision not to apply ED (we were a bit
                        nervous).
                        Above all, however, what we are most grateful for is that Elena gave him the
                        confidence to be himself and to truly speak in first person regarding his goals and
                        interests, all of which will continue to serve him well! His essays were so
                        authentically him!

                        I cannot say enough good things about Elena. My son was accepted at seven of the
                        eight schools to which he applied and there is no question Elena played an essential
                        role in that success. Throughout the process of working with us, Elena became a
                        close friend and someone I admire deeply. It’s hard to imagine a more skilled and
                        sensitive guide through such an angst-ridden journey. She helped keep both my son,
                        my wife and me sane. Working with her unquestionably avoided a lot of tension in
                        our household. 
                        
                        Time and time again, Elena managed to walk the line with Henry of being
                        encouraging and helpful while also upholding accountability. She is highly
                        emotionally intelligent, and was really focused on learning all she could about who
                        Henry is as a student and a person, and then using that understanding to help him
                        reach his own conclusion about what was the right school for him and the best way
                        of getting in there.
                        Elena was easy to reach via email, text or phone, and found time for us whenever we
                        needed it. She also does the little things that can make a big difference in the
                        process—finding out which schools have strong programs in a given interest, digging
                        up helpful website links, tracking down the right people to contact in a department,
                        relevant, testimonials, etc. The little things that actually made a difference in my
                        son’s decision making process. We really miss being in touch with her!

                    Working with Elena has been an absolute pleasure! The dedication and work she and
                    her team put in cannot be overstated. Before working with her, I was lost in the

                    me to plan and organize my application and admission journey. Elena helped me not
                    only craft a coherent and compelling application but also find my voice, ensuring my
                    personality shone through in every piece of writing. She and her editor, Angela,
                    promptly reviewed every single one of my essays with care and honesty, and didn&#39;t
                    hold back to ensure they were perfect. Angela&#39;s thoughtful and relentless critiques
                    were instrumental in polishing and elevating my essays. Thanks to their guidance, I
                    couldn’t be happier with my results.

                    with my daughter on her college search last year. Elena walked with us on a
                    complicated journey over many months as we navigated each step. She advised us
                    on every aspect of our search, including on college options, testing strategies,
                    applications, visits, and interviews. Elena is always patient, generous with her time,
                    extremely knowledgeable, and caring. She is also wonderfully straightforward and
                    direct, and her approach is exactly what we needed to help our daughter choose the
                    best college for her. As a result of Elena’s hard work with our family, our daughter
                    gained admission to several extremely competitive colleges, including her top choice.

                    opportunities for increasing college acceptance chances and she has an extensive
                    network that enables her to do that. She can relate to both teenagers and parents,
                    to people of different cultural and economic backgrounds. Her experience,
                    intelligence, knowledge, integrity, and warmth help to remove a lot of stress from

                    When I first started the college admissions process, I didn’t know where to start.
                    Everything was so overwhelming, and although I knew that I wanted to find a college
                    I loved, I didn’t know how to. From my first meeting with Elena, all that changed.
                    Elena helped me create a clear plan to get through the next six months of work. She
                    linked me with an excellent SAT tutor (who helped raise my score 120 points),
                    recommended colleges she knew I would love, explained the behind-the-scenes of
                    the college admissions process, turned my ideas from rough ideas to polished
                    finished products, and encouraged me the whole time. Elena is an excellent
                    professional, and shared her years of experience with the sole intention of finding
                    my best-fit college. As a person, Elena is funny, no-nonsense, and incredibly kind. I
                    couldn’t be more happy with my decision to reach out to her. Next year, I will attend
                    Middlebury College. I am so excited! I couldn’t have done it without Elena. I cannot
                    recommend her more highly. I wish you the best in your application process!

                    Elena Polenova is a Godsend. She counseled my son through the college application
                    process and he has been accepted with generous merit scholarship offers at all of his
                    top choices. Elena&#39;s experience and understanding of the process is invaluable and
                    easily saved us tens of thousands of dollars in tuition expenses. She helped my son
                    choose topics for his college essays and once he wrote them she had them rigorously
                    
                    and skillfully copy-edited for submission. Hiring Elena is a no-brainer if you care
                    about your child&#39;s success.

                    Elena shepherded us through this messy process and helped us stay sane. We
                    learned a lot about ourselves and about our son through the journey, and are very
                    grateful for that. 
                    There are so many good things to say about working with Elena and her team.
                    Elena’s insights, advice, suggestions were spot on. She kept it real, but was always
                    positive and helped our son stay positive. She let him know that the decisions were
                    his to make, and even respected his decision not to apply ED (we were a bit
                    nervous).
                    Above all, however, what we are most grateful for is that Elena gave him the
                    confidence to be himself and to truly speak in first person regarding his goals and
                    interests, all of which will continue to serve him well! His essays were so
                    authentically him!

                    I cannot say enough good things about Elena. My son was accepted at seven of the
                    eight schools to which he applied and there is no question Elena played an essential
                    role in that success. Throughout the process of working with us, Elena became a
                    close friend and someone I admire deeply. It’s hard to imagine a more skilled and
                    sensitive guide through such an angst-ridden journey. She helped keep both my son,
                    my wife and me sane. Working with her unquestionably avoided a lot of tension in
                    our household. 
                    
                    Time and time again, Elena managed to walk the line with Henry of being
                    encouraging and helpful while also upholding accountability. She is highly
                    emotionally intelligent, and was really focused on learning all she could about who
                    Henry is as a student and a person, and then using that understanding to help him
                    reach his own conclusion about what was the right school for him and the best way
                    of getting in there.
                    Elena was easy to reach via email, text or phone, and found time for us whenever we
                    needed it. She also does the little things that can make a big difference in the
                    process—finding out which schools have strong programs in a given interest, digging
                    up helpful website links, tracking down the right people to contact in a department,
                    relevant, testimonials, etc. The little things that actually made a difference in my
                    son’s decision making process. We really miss being in touch with her!
