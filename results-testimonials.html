                    I am happy there is a place where I can share how great Dr. Elena Polenova was for us. She provided invaluable advice to us starting when we were deciding on a boarding high school for my daughter. Elena continued helping us all the way through college applications. She helped orient us through schools and majors and then took everything steps further as she helped my daughter with perfecting her applications so she could represent her best self that we saw in her. Elena is very supportive and truly understands both family needs and child's interests and strengths. My daughter is a happy sophomore now at NYU!

                    Elena was the most important piece to my admission process. As the oldest child in my family, I was very naive about the process and would have become lost in the essays and communications with all of the universities. Her great experience in this field is an incredible asset. With Elena's commitment to me and my goals, she developed into not only a mentor but honestly a friend, with whom I could talk freely, and for whom I had and will have a continuous respect and gratitude. I can not speak any more highly of Elena, nor thank her enough for everything she has done.

                    When I first started the college admissions process, I didn’t know where to start. Everything was so overwhelming, and although I knew that I wanted to find a college I loved, I didn’t know how to. From my first meeting with Elena, all that changed. Elena helped me create a clear plan to get through the next six months of work. She linked me with an excellent SAT tutor (who helped raise my score 120 points), recommended colleges she knew I would love, explained the behind-the-scenes of the college admissions process, turned my ideas from rough ideas to polished finished products, and encouraged me the whole time. Elena is an excellent professional, and shared her years of experience with the sole intention of finding my best-fit college. As a person, Elena is funny, no-nonsense, and incredibly kind. I couldn’t be more happy with my decision to reach out to her. Next year, I will attend Middlebury College. I am so excited! I couldn’t have done it without Elena. I cannot recommend her more highly. I wish you the best in your application process!
